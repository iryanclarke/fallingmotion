                	The final product will be featured as an interactive website specializing and
                    showcasing motion capture content which includes step by step tutorials, helpful tips,
                    photos, videos, and dynamic jQuery that will  enhance and elevate the userâ€™s learning
                    experience to the next level. The primary goal is use visually engaging elements such as
                    parallax scrolling to create a timeline of events whereby the user can assimilate
                    information in incremental stages starting from the basics progressing gradually into
                    more complicated matters. Furthermore, the main reason why parallax scrolling is
                    utilized rather than the traditional website layout is because we wanted to create a
                    continuous and flowing experience for the user. This means that the majority of the
                    content will be featured on one single page with multiple sections that will contain
                    specific content related to the motion capture. As a result, this will eliminate the
                    necessity for the user to switch to another page to view additional information which we
                    found to be one of the main problems associated with previous examples of motion
                    capture learning centers. Although the user may have completed their journey and have now
                    mastered the basics of motion capture we will also show them that this is in fact only the
                    beginning of their journey, for they now have the tools to further pursue more in depth
                    studies and undertake more creative challenges with motion capture. At this point
                    we will highlight examples of motion capture that have already been done in films such as
                	Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Tron.
